# FitnessLog
For my capstone project, I developed a comprehensive fitness application tailored to enhance individual health and wellness. Utilizing Swift and developed in Xcode, this sophisticated app offers unique features designed to monitor and promote various aspects of a user's health. Key functionalities include:

Water Tracking: Helps users stay hydrated by tracking their daily water intake. Calorie Tracking: Logs daily caloric consumption. Sleep Tracking: Monitors sleep pattern. Mood Tracking: Allows users to record their mood. Journal Feature: Enables users to keep a personal journal, encouraging them to document their fitness journey and reflect on their daily experiences and progress. Weight Tracking: Enables the user to track their weight.
